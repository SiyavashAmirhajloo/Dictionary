# Dictionary Project

This is a dictionary project implemented in C++. It utilizes an AVL tree data structure to efficiently store and manage a collection of words and their definitions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `AVL.h`: Contains the definition of the AVL class, which represents the AVL tree data structure.
- `Dictionary.h`: Contains the definition of the Dictionary class, which serves as a wrapper for the AVL tree and provides dictionary-specific operations.
- `Node.h`: Contains the definition of the Node class, representing a node in the AVL tree.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main entry point of the program and the user interface for interacting with the dictionary.

## Usage

To use the dictionary, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Build and compile the project.
4. Run the compiled executable.

Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with several options:

- **Search a word**: Allows you to search for a specific word in the dictionary.
- **Search by first letter**: Displays all words in the dictionary starting with a given letter.
- **Add a word to dictionary**: Enables you to add a new word and its definition to the dictionary.
- **Delete a word from dictionary**: Lets you remove a word from the dictionary.
- **Show the dictionary**: Displays the entire dictionary in alphabetical order.
- **Exit**: Terminates the program.

Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies and can be compiled and run with a standard C++ compiler.
